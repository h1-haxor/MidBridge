# MidBridge
MITMAttacker is a Python-based tool designed to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on a specified network. It intercepts and modifies traffic between the router and target devices, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data and potentially compromise the security of the network.
